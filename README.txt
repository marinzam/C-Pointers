Lab16 C Pointers

This lab was focused on practicing using C Pointers and how we can create functions that passes a pointer of a certain element, rather than passing in the element, to make changes to those elements. The program uses mystrcmp() to compare two char arrays, mystrcpy() to copy a char array into another char array, and mystrcat() to add a char array to an existing char array. For the program to type “Hello, Geraldine”, one of arguments must be “Geraldine” with a capital G.
